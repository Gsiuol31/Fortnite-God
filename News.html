	<h2>
	Limited Time Mashup:
		<strong>Infinity Gauntlet</strong>
	</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Mashup Details
			<ul>
				<li>Early in the match, a meteor will land in the storm safe zone, delivering the Infinity Gauntlet.</li>
				<li>Any player who uses the Infinity Gauntlet will transform into Thanos.</li>
				<li>Stats are recorded for this LTM and can be found in the Solo tab.</li>
				<li>If Thanos is eliminated, the Gauntlet will fall to the ground, free for the taking. If it sits unused for too long, it will disappear until another meteor appears.</li>
				<li>Last player standing will be the victor!</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Take down Thanos, equip the Gauntlet and claim Victory!</li>
		<li>Thanos Details
			<ul>
				<li>
				<em>Ability 1</em>
				- A mighty punch that knocks enemies back and destroys structures.</li>
				<li>
				<em>Ability 2 </em>
				- Thanos flies towards the ground, hitting an area for knockback and damage.</li>
				<li>
				<em>Ability 3 </em>
				- Harness the energy of the Power stone to fire a blast that deals damage over time.</li>
				<li>
				<em>Ability 4</em>
				- A super-jump that can vault Thanos over all but the largest obstructions.</li>
				<li>Thanos has both shields and health. When he eliminates another player, his shields regenerate. His health never regenerates.</li>
				<li>Thanos doesn't take fall damage.</li>
				<li>Thanos does not build, use weapons or things like launch pads. He has no need for such petty human devices.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Storm + Map
			<ul>Storm + Map
				<li>Maximum match length is roughly 15 minutes.</li>
